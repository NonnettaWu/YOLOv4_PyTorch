## YOLOv4_PyTorch

Similar to YOLOv3.

With Google Colab provides a plant for training, the repository was creted to use `YOLOv4` model to detect objects. The most codes are copied from `Bubbliiiing`. 

His repository: https://github.com/bubbliiiing

For contrasting with other models, imageSize is set to [3, 640, 640]. Besides, pre_weights have been used for training.You can do lots of settings in this Model with detailed exegesises.

The running environments has been supported in requirements.txt.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple -y
```
`YOLOv4 Structure` is below:
